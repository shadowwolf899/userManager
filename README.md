# userManager
This is a basic script I wrote in bash to allow quickly managing user accounts and systems (Only works on ubuntu)

Features:
	
	List all exisiting users
	Specify who should be admins and who should be users
	Set passwords for each account (one password for all admins and one for all standard users)
	Delete unauthorized accounts
	Make sure normal users are not admins
	Lock out root account
	Lock out guest account (only works on some distros, mainly Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 14.04)
	Sets some default password policies
	Enable automatic updates
	Updates software
	Setup firewall
	Disable SSH root login
