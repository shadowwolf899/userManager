# userManager
This is a basic script I wrote in python to allow quickly managing user accounts

*NOTE: This script is being converted to bash and will not recieve any updates until that is done, but I will add new features while that is happening.

Features:
	
	List all exisiting users
	Specify who should be admins and who should be users
	Set passwords for each account (either one password for all admins and one for all standard users or different passwords for each account)
	Delete unauthorized accounts
	Make sure normal users are not admins
	Lock out root account
	Lock out guest account (only works on some distros, mainly Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 14.04)
