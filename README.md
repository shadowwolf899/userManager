# userManager
This is a basic script I wrote in python to allow quickly managing user accounts

Features:
	
	List all exisiting users
	Specify who should be admins and who should be users
	Set passwords for each account (either one password for all admins and one for all standard users or different passwords for each account)
	Delete unauthorized accounts
	Make sure normal users are not admins
	Lock out root account
	Lock out guest account (only works on some distros, mainly Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 14.04)
